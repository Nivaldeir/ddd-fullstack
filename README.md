# Uber Variation

Techniques that were developed through Rodrigo Branas' course, 
The segment on "RabbitMQ" was particularly interesting, providing insight into asynchronous communication in systems. “Test Driven Development” has completely changed my perspective on how to approach programming, putting tests at the center of the development process.
"Domain-Driven Design" showed me the importance of modeling software around the business domain, making everything more aligned and cohesive. On the other hand, with the "Event-Driven Architecture", the effectiveness of responsive and adaptive systems was realized.
Finally, the "SOLID Principles" consolidated my understanding of object-oriented software design. These concepts, which used to be abstract, are now part of my daily life as a developer, thanks to Rodrigo's didactics and expertise.
In summary, this course has been a deep journey into the world of quality software development, and I feel immensely more prepared and confident in my technical skills.
